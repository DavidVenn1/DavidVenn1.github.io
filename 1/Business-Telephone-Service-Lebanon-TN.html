IP PBX can be either hardware, software application, or both. These systems connect a primary business number to mobile phones. Data from Statista revealed that there were 6.2 million VoIP business customers in 2010. Many small businesses, business owners, and start-ups use VoIP services for their companies, due to the fact that it generally includes additional functions and can cost less than a traditional business phone service.</p>

<p>Softphones often sport an interface that resembles conventional telephones, so using them must be a breeze. However, for other power users and managers who often participate in conferences and work in the office far from their desk, a wireless or mobile option can extend communications wherever they remain in or out of the office. Your phone lines connect to the system, which can connect as much as multiple handsets - both cordless (DECT) and repaired desk handsets.</p>
